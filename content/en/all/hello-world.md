Hi! I’m Artem and I’m JavaScript developer at Badoo in Moscow, Russia. I do some freelance and [open source](https://github.com/sapegin) too. I’m also a passionate [photographer](https://morning.photos) who lives with beautiful wife and two awesome (though a bit crazy) dogs.

I’ve been blogging for eight years about photography and for five years about web development in Russian but it’s the first time I’m blogging in English. I don’t speak English very well so you’ll find a lot of mistakes here. I’ll be happy to fix them with your help.

I plan to write here mostly about frontend development. Probably something about photography, my life and other things if it’s interesting for you. Feel free to drop me a line here or [there](https://sapegin.me/).
