Everyone can help an open source project: you don’t have to be a programmer or a terminal guru. There are other stuff besides code in open source projects: documentation, for example. And there are a lot of projects without code at all: [books](https://github.com/showcases/writing) and some others.

But not everybody knows that it’s possible using only a browser.

Find a file you want to edit on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (you need to be logged in) and press Edit button:

Edit and save a file:

Just after saving you’ll be prompted to send a pull request:

![GitHub: creating a pull request](/images/github_pull_request_en.png)

Describe your changes and press Send pull request button.

That’s all, you’ve made the world a bit better.
